## Overview of Projects

In this repository, we have worked on different deep learning projects such as:
- **Cat vs Dog Classifier**: A CNN-based image classification model that classifies images as either a cat or a dog.
- **Basic Deep Learning Notebooks**: These include examples and simple deep learning applications to demonstrate how neural networks work and how convolutional layers can be applied to image data.

## Technologies and Methods Used

In these projects, the following machine learning and deep learning techniques have been utilized:

- **TensorFlow and Keras**: Libraries used to build and train the neural networks.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**: Used for image-related tasks like classifying cats and dogs.
- **Data Augmentation**: Applied to increase the diversity of the training data and improve model generalization.
- **Activation Functions (ReLU, Sigmoid)**: Used in different parts of the neural network to introduce non-linearity and for binary classification.
- **Dropout Regularization**: Used to prevent overfitting by randomly disabling neurons during training.
- **Adam Optimizer**: Optimizer used to speed up convergence during training.
- **Binary Crossentropy Loss**: Loss function used in binary classification tasks.
